        The web3r.chat project and the demonstartion bots 
        are created & owned by [Arjaan Buijk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjaanbuijk/).\n\n
        The initial architecture and the foundational bot-0 dApp, the one you're chatting 
        with, were developed as part of a DFINITY Foundation grant, in early 2022."

        Motoko is the native Internet Computer language for writing Smart Contracts. 
        It compiles to WebAssembly, and the compiler automatically generates Candid APIs 
        and bindings for Javascript, for easy integration in the dApp's frontend.\n\n
        The Smart Contracts can be written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly,
        like Rust & C"
